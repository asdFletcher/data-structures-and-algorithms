# Radix sort

### Description
Sort numbers. Do this by analyzing and comparing each digit in the given numbers.

### Runtime and efficiency

Time: O(n*k) , where n is hte number of elements, and k is the number of digits in the number.

If k is known to be 3, for say, our example data set, we can say O(3n) , which becomes O(n)! For example, sorting ages.
