### Binary Trees:

- [Binary search tree (BST)](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/binary-search-tree)
  - A standard binary search tree
  - Includes tests
  - Includes [readme](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/binary-search-tree)
  
- [AVL Tree](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/avl-tree)
  - A self-balancing binary search tree, which saves node height
  - Includes tests
  - Includes [readme](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/avl-tree)
  
- [Splay Tree](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/splay-tree)
  - A self-balancing binary search tree, which doesn't save height information
  - Includes tests
  - Includes [readme](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/data-structures/splay-tree)

### Sorting algorithms:
- [Insertion sort](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/code-challenges/insertionSort)
- [Quick sort](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/code-challenges/quickSort)
- [Radix sort](https://github.com/asdFletcher/data-structures-and-algorithms/tree/master/src/code-challenges/radixSort)
