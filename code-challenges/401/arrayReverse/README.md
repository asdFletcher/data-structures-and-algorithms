# Code Challenge 01 - Array Reverse

# Reverse an Array
As part of our whiteboarding and coding experience progression, we're solving this problem on the whiteboard. This particular problem is simply to reverse an array.

## Challenge
Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order.

## Approach & Efficiency
Start at the end of the existing array and insert the values into a new array. The run time is O(n) and the space is O(n). The more advanced solution we came up with was to use an in-place swap and a while loop, but didn't code this up due to time.
